I was under too much of a crunch at the time and there wasn't enough\ndialogue to justify writing (or setting up) a simple JSON schema checker.\nBut the day after the jam ended, I wrote a self-contained webpage that they could have used.</p>\n<p>The next weekend, I created a simplified <a href=\"https://example.com/FIXME\">reactflow</a>-based prototype\nfor uploading images, placing script-line nodes that use those character images,\nand connecting them.

I also set up a backend service and web assembly compilation.\nThen on September 19th, 2023, I started working on a much smaller project which had some feature,\ncross-over, so I copy-pasted my refined prototype into a new repository and got to work...</p>\n<h3>Step 2, don't sleep</h3>\n<p>September 19th, 2023 I posted in a private discord (I should really start microblogging).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/FIXME\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n<p>the following weekend, following the outcry at Unity's new pricing, I decided I was going to take a break from my larger project to do this much smaller one.</p>\n<h3>Step 3, sleep a little bit</h3>\n<h3>Step 4, oh snap I have two kids now</h3>\n<h3>Step 5, get lazy (burnout)</h3>\n<h3>Step 5, push through</h3>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 20, 2023","path":"/blog/getting-started","title":"Getting started"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/test/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
